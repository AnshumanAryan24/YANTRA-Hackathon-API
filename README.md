# YANTRA_Hackathon-API
This contains part of the project code. Code here is responsible for handling the AI/ML based part of the project.

## API v2:
1. This edition is to be used.
2. On-the-go detection.
3. Control parameter Z_ALPHA can be used to control accuracy.
4. Use the process() function only - functions begining from '__' are supposed to be treated as private functions
