This repository has the tools and libraries responsible from the proper functioning of our project 'Vach Sahay'. The code in the repository AI/ML part of the project. 

## API v2:
1. This edition is to be used.
2. On-the-go detection.
3. Control parameter Z_ALPHA can be used to control accuracy.
4. Use the process() function only - functions begining from '__' are supposed to be treated as private functions

## API:
1. This is the version 1 of the API used. We have moved on to the second version of the same API.
